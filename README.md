# Mouser - Simple automated mouse cursor movement

Mouser is a simple console application that will automatically move your mouse cursor.
I created this to keep my online status in the most apps we're using in our company.

There is nothing fancy here, just a few lines of code.

**Made for Windows OS!**

###### Usage

Run the `Mouser.exe` file located in the `bin` directory, or compile the `main.cpp` file.
To close stop the program execution, press `ctrl + C`.
